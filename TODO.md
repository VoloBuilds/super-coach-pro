# Super Coach Pro
## Project Description
We are building an AI-powered fitness app called 'Super Coach Pro'. The app will allow users to configure workout routines and diet plans and review their progress over time. Here are the core features:
- Workout Planner
- Diet Planner
- Calendar
- AI Chat to get recommendations

The user should be able to plan a workout and diet and add the workout to their calendar
There should be a 'live' mode for the workouts where they can press 'start' and begin tracking their sets. Once complete, the data will be stored for that day and they can reference it later.
